# Breast iCAD CDE Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the **Common Data Elements (CDEs)** for the *ProFound Breast iCAD* dataset. These elements define the key structured data points used for breast imaging AI assessments, including **AI detection case scores** and **breast density assessments**.

## Data Elements

### 1. ProFound AI Detection Case Score
- **Description:** AI-generated score assessing the likelihood of malignancy.
- **Data Type:** `Integer (0-100)`
- **Range:** `0 to 100`

### 2. PowerLook Density Assessment
- **Description:** AI-assessed breast density classification.
- **Data Type:** `Float (1.0 - 4.99)`
- **Categories:**
  - `1.0 - 1.99` → **A (Very Low)**
  - `2.0 - 2.99` → **B (Scattered)**
  - `3.0 - 3.99` → **C (Heterogeneously Dense)**
  - `4.0 - 4.99` → **D (Extremely Dense)**

## Usage
- This dataset structure is designed to be **ingested into imaging databases** and **AI-driven diagnostic systems**.
- Future enhancements can include additional **imaging metrics, confidence scores,** and **physician annotations**.
