  "description": " Shoulder arthritis is a degenerative joint condition which is characterized by the gradual breakdown of cartilage in the shoulder joint. Radiological assessment reveals joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, subchondral sclerosis, and sometimes cyst formation in the glenohumeral or acromioclavicular joints. Imaging modalities such as X-rays or MRI are utilized to evaluate the extent of joint damage.",
