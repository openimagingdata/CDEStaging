## Solid Tissue Type

- **Papillary projection**
  - *Definition*: enhancing solid component with a branching architecture arising from inner or outer wall or septation; ≥ 3 mm in height
  - *Synonyms*: papillary excrescence, papillations, frond-like projection, polypoid projection
- **Mural nodule**
  - *Definition*: enhancing, rounded, nodular structure ≥ 3 mm, arising from wall or septation
  - *Synonyms*: mural-based nodule, internal nodule, focal wall thickening
- **Irregular wall / septation**
  - *Definition*: enhancing wall or linear septation with uneven margins
  - *Synonyms*: irregularly enhancing septum, nodular septation, uneven wall contour
- **Larger solid portion**
  - *Definition*: solid enhancing tissue that does not conform to papillary, mural nodule, or irregular wall/septation categories
  - *Synonyms*: indeterminate solid tissue, mass-like component, large solid focus

## Solid Contour

- **Smooth**
  - *Definition*: regular, even margin of the solid tissue
  - *Synonyms*: well-defined margin, smooth-bordered, circumscribed contour
- **Irregular**
  - *Definition*: uneven, angulated, or spiculated margin of the solid tissue
  - *Synonyms*: ill-defined margin, irregular border, lobulated contour

## Solid T2 Signal

- **Hypointense**
  - *Definition*: signal intensity lower than or equal to iliopsoas muscle
  - *Synonyms*: T2 dark, low T2 signal, dark signal on T2
- **Intermediate**
  - *Definition*: signal higher than iliopsoas and lower than CSF
  - *Synonyms*: iso-intense on T2, intermediate intensity, mildly hyperintense on T2
- **Hyperintense**
  - *Definition*: signal equal to or greater than CSF
  - *Synonyms*: T2 bright, high T2 signal, hyperintense on T2

## Solid DWI Signal

- **Low**
  - *Definition*: signal similar to urine or CSF on high-b value diffusion-weighted imaging
  - *Synonyms*: no diffusion restriction, low signal on DWI, benign appearance
- **High**
  - *Definition*: signal clearly higher than urine or CSF on high-b value DWI
  - *Synonyms*: diffusion restriction, high DWI signal, restricted diffusion

## Solid Enhancement Pattern

- **TIC-Low**
  - *Definition*: gradual increase in time-signal intensity curve with no shoulder or plateau; low slope enhancement curve
  - *Synonyms*: progressive enhancement, slow enhancement, benign time intensity curve
- **TIC-Intermediate**
  - *Definition*: moderate signal increase in time-signal intensity curve with plateau; initial slope ≤ myometrium
  - *Synonyms*: moderate enhancement curve, plateau-type curve
- **TIC-High**
  - *Definition*: steep slope of time-signal intensity curve, rapid enhancement, exceeding myometrial enhancement with plateau
  - *Synonyms*: aggressive enhancement, malignant curve, fast-rising TIC
- **≤ Myometrium**
  - *Definition*: non-dynamic enhancement less than or equal to outer myometrium at 30–40 seconds post-injection
  - *Synonyms*: mild enhancement, equal to uterine wall, hypoenhancing
- **> Myometrium**
  - *Definition*: non-dynamic enhancement greater than outer myometrium at 30–40 seconds post-injection
  - *Synonyms*: hyperenhancing, strong enhancement, suspicious uptake

## Cyst Fluid Type

- **Simple**
  - *Definition*: follows CSF/urine on all sequences (T2 hyperintense; T1 hypointense)
  - *Synonyms*: anechoic, CSF-like, clear fluid
- **Hemorrhagic**
  - *Definition*: variable depending on age; may appear hyperintense on both T2WI and T1WI
  - *Synonyms*: blood-filled, hemorrhagic contents, clotted cyst
- **Endometriotic**
  - *Definition*: T2 hypointense and T1 hyperintense
  - *Synonyms*: endometrioma, chocolate cyst, hemosiderin-laden
- **Proteinaceous / Mucinous**
  - *Definition*: variable on T2WI and variably hypointense on T1WI
  - *Synonyms*: thick fluid, viscous fluid, colloid
- **Lipid-containing**
  - *Definition*: T2 and T1 hyperintense; loses signal on fat-saturated or out-of-phase sequences
  - *Synonyms*: fatty, dermoid, sebaceous

## Maximum Solid Diameter (mm)

- *Definition*: largest diameter of the enhancing solid tissue in any imaging plane
- *Synonyms*: solid component size, nodular thickness, max solid focus
