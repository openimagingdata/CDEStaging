# Solid Lesion CDE

## Contour

- **Smooth**
  - *Definition*: regular, even margin of the solid lesion
  - *Synonyms*: circumscribed, well-defined margin, smooth outline
- **Irregular**
  - *Definition*: uneven, lobulated, angulated, or spiculated margin of the solid lesion
  - *Synonyms*: ill-defined, lobulated margin, angulated edge, irregular contour

## T2 Signal

- **Hypointense**
  - *Definition*: signal intensity equal to or lower than iliopsoas muscle
  - *Synonyms*: T2 dark, low T2 signal, hypointense on T2WI
- **Intermediate**
  - *Definition*: signal intensity greater than iliopsoas and less than CSF
  - *Synonyms*: intermediate T2 signal, iso-intense to muscle, mildly hyperintense
- **Hyperintense**
  - *Definition*: signal intensity equal to or greater than CSF
  - *Synonyms*: T2 bright, high T2 signal, hyperintense on T2WI

## DWI Signal

- **Low**
  - *Definition*: signal similar to urine or CSF on high-b value diffusion-weighted imaging
  - *Synonyms*: low DWI signal, no diffusion restriction, benign diffusion
- **High**
  - *Definition*: signal clearly higher than urine or CSF on high-b value DWI
  - *Synonyms*: diffusion restriction, restricted diffusion, high signal on DWI

## Enhancement Pattern

- **TIC-Low**
  - *Definition*: minimal and gradual increase in enhancement; no plateau or shoulder
  - *Synonyms*: slow uptake, benign curve, gradual enhancement
- **TIC-Intermediate**
  - *Definition*: moderate enhancement with plateau; initial slope ≤ myometrium
  - *Synonyms*: plateau-type curve, intermediate enhancement, equivocal TIC
- **TIC-High**
  - *Definition*: rapid enhancement greater than myometrium with plateau
  - *Synonyms*: malignant-type curve, steep enhancement, fast enhancement
- **≤ Myometrium**
  - *Definition*: non-dynamic enhancement less than or equal to outer myometrium at 30–40 seconds
  - *Synonyms*: hypoenhancing, equal to myometrium, mild uptake
- **> Myometrium**
  - *Definition*: non-dynamic enhancement greater than outer myometrium at 30–40 seconds
  - *Synonyms*: strong enhancement, hyperenhancing, suspicious enhancement

## Cystic Volume Percent

- **0–20**
  - *Definition*: less than 20% of lesion volume is cystic; lesion is considered solid by O-RADS definition
  - *Synonyms*: mostly solid, solid-predominant, >80% solid

## Maximum Diameter (mm)

- *Definition*: largest diameter of the lesion in any imaging plane
- *Synonyms*: maximum size, lesion diameter, long axis measurement
