This is a staging area for definitions of radiology common data elements (CDEs) in JSON format (see [radelement.org](https://www.radelement.org) for more information on the joint ACR/RSNA CDE project) prior to their entering the review pipeline.

Documentation/tips on how to author CDE Sets in the JSON will be stored `docs` directory. See the [JSON schema](blob/master/cde.schema.json) definition in [its repo](https://github.com/RSNA/ACR-RSNA-CDEs/).

Provisional CDE definitions can be stored in the `definitions` directory, with separate folders for participating vendors.
