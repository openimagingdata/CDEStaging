# CDEStaging

This is a staging area for definitions of radiology common data elements (CDEs) in JSON format (see [radelement.org](https://www.radelement.org) for more information on the joint ACR/RSNA CDE project) prior to their entering the review pipeline.

Documentation on how to author CDE Sets in the JSON are in the `docs` directory.

Provisional CDE definitions are stored in the `schemas` directory; each inidividual/organization storing CDE Set definitions here should fork this repository, create their definitions within a folder named for their organization within the `schemas` directory, and submit a pull request to have the files included on the main repository.
