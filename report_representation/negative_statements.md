# Compositve Negative Statements

## Abdomen

- Normal. No abnormality in the upper abdomen

- The adrenal glands are unremarkable

- The study is not designed to evaluate for intra-abdominal abnormality. The adrenal glands
are unremarkable

- Unchanged segment 4A hepatic cyst. Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings.

- No abnormality detected in the visualized upper abdomen. Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings.

- Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings.

- Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings. No focal abnormality within the imaged liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands or renal upper poles.

- There is moderate calcification of the visualized abdominal aorta without aneurysmal dilatation.

- Normal. No abnormality detected in the visualized upper abdomen. Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings.
