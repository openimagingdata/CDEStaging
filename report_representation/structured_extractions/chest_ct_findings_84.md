Devices/Tubes/LINES: Right internal jugular port catheter terminates in the right atrium.
LUNGS: There are multiple small peribronchial ground-glass nodules and opacities in both lungs, predominately in the lower lobes and associated with linear opacities with subpleural sparing and architectural distortion. Mild diffuse bronchial wall thickening and bronchiectasis. The central airways are patent.
PLEURA: Small left pleural effusion is new. No pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: Heart size is normal. New small pericardial effusion. Focal pericardial calcification. No coronary calcification. Relative low attenuation of the central blood pool in the left ventricle compared to myocardium, reflecting underlying anemia.
LYMPH NODES: No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: High attenuation of the liver, reflecting iron deposition. Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass.
BONES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
