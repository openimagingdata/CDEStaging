# Report Text

Devices/Tubes/Lines: None.
Lungs: Unchanged bilateral pulmonary nodules, including a 4 mm nodule in the right upper lobe (13:141), a 3 mm subpleural nodule in the left upper lobe (13:183), and a 5 mm nodule in the right middle lobe (13:246). No new pulmonary nodules. Central airways are patent.
Pleura: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Unchanged hypoattenuating bilateral thyroid nodules. Heart size is normal. Lipomatous hypertrophy of the interatrial septum. No pericardial effusion. No coronary calcification. Small hiatal hernia.
Lymph Nodes: No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
Upper Abdomen: Unchanged segment 4A hepatic cyst. Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings.
Chest Wall: No chest wall mass.
Bones: Multilevel degenerative changes of the spine. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
