Devices/Tubes/LINES: Esophageal stent remains in the upper esophagus across the anastomosis.
LUNGS: Right upper lobe nodule on series 4 image 58 measures 3 mm and is unchanged. There are linear bands of atelectasis in the lower lobes as well as round atelectasis in the basilar right lower lobe. The central airways are patent.
PLEURA: Minimal right pleural thickening. No effusions.
MEDIASTINUM: Normal heart size. No pericardial effusion. There are mild coronary artery calcifications. Postsurgical changes are identified from esophagectomy with gastric pull-through. Previously seen surgical drain in the mediastinum has been removed. There is an unchanged small gas collection at the level of the subcarinal space  measuring 1.3 cm on series 2 image 48, unchanged.
LYMPH NODES: Normal. No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: No abnormality detected in the visualized upper abdomen.
CHEST WALL: Normal. No chest wall mass.
BONES: Partially imaged cervical spine fusion. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
