Lines/TUBES:  The tip of the RIGHT Port-A-Cath is in the RIGHT atrium.
LUNGS AND AIRWAYS:  There is bilateral dependent atelectasis. There are stable scattered small lung nodules, best seen in the LEFT lower lobe 72, 80 and 89 measuring up to 3 mm. There are no new nodules. 
PLEURA: The pleural spaces are clear.
HEART AND MEDIASTINUM: The thyroid gland is normal.  No significant mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy is seen. The cardiac chambers are within normal limits. There is increased pericardial mass along the lateral wall of the LEFT ventricle and LEFT atrial appendage, measures 8.9 x 2.8 cm compared to 7.3 x 1.8 cm. There are stable postsurgical changes in the LEFT ventricular apex. There are no new or increased mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes. There are stable hypodensities in the thymus, best seen on image 49.
SOFT TISSUES: There is no significant axillary or subpectoral lymphadenopathy.
ABDOMEN: Please refer to separately dictated abdominal CT report.
BONES: The patient is status post median sternotomy. There are mild degenerative changes in the visualized spine. There is a hemangioma in T7 vertebral body. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
