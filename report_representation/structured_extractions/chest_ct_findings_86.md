Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: Redemonstration of peribronchial scarring and architectural distortion in both lungs likely sequelae of prior organizing pneumonia from Covid 19 infection. No pulmonary nodules or consolidation. The airways are clear.
PLEURA: Trace left and small right pleural effusions are stable. No pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: There is worsening pneumomediastinum mostly noted within the anterior mediastinum with small specks of gas seen posteriorly adjacent to the esophagus. Mild thickening and patulous appearance of the lower thoracic esophagus. No thyroid nodules. Heart and pericardium are normal. No coronary calcification.
LYMPH NODES: No newly enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Cholecystectomy. No abnormality detected in the visualized upper abdomen. Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings.
CHEST WALL: Worsening subcutaneous emphysema in the lower neck. No chest wall mass.
BONES: Diffuse osteopenia. Severe wedging and compression deformity of a lower thoracic vertebral body 5:66 unchanged. Few hemangiomas in the mid thoracic spine. No new suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
