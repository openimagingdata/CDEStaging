Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: No suspicious pulmonary nodules or consolidation. The airways are clear.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: No thyroid nodules. Normal heart size. Trace fluid along the pericardial recesses. Trace amorphous soft tissue along the anterior mediastinum, likely residual thymus (2:38), similar.
LYMPH NODES: No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: No abnormality detected in the visualized upper abdomen. Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass. No evidence of pectus deformity. Similar anatomic appearing fragmentation and minimally bowing of the inferior sternum/xiphoid, with unchanged linear soft tissue along the inferior margin (2:94), without surrounding stranding, unchanged compared to multiple priors. No mediastinal fat stranding.
BONES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
