# Report Text

Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: Unchanged focal bronchiectasis in inferior right upper lobe with endobronchial mucous plugging (7:219). Unchanged 4 mm right lower lobe subpleural triangular nodule on image 406 of series 7 which is consistent with a benign intrapulmonary lymph node. No focal consolidation. The central airways are clear.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: Unchanged bilateral small fat-containing Bochdalek hernias (right larger than left). Heart size is normal. No pericardial effusion. Mild amount of coronary calcifications.
LYMPH NODES: No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: cholecystectomy. Colonic diverticulosis. Atherosclerotic calcifications in partially imaged upper abdominal aorta. Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass.
BONES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. Multilevel degenerative changes in the spine.
