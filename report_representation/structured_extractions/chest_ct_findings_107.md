Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: There are secretions in the trachea. There is mild diffuse bronchial wall thickening with endobronchial mucus plugging in the subsegmental bronchi. There is mild bibasilar atelectasis. Unchanged mild biapical pleural-parenchymal scarring. There are calcified granulomas. Unchanged solid noncalcified 2 mm nodule in the right upper lobe (303:190) since 12/2021. There are no new or enlarging pulmonary nodules.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: No thyroid nodules in the imaged portion of the thyroid gland. The cardiac chambers are normal in size. There is no pericardial effusion. Aortic valve and punctate left ventricle of papillary muscle calcifications. 
LYMPH NODES: No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Please see concurrent abdominal CT for abdominal findings.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass.
