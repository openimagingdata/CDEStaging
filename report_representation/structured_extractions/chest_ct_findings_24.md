Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
Lungs: Again noted is complete consolidation of the left upper lobe. 
The cavitary lesion with soft tissue component in the superior segment of the left lower
lobe measures 4.7 x 5.3 x 3.4 cm collectively (image 15, series 2). While the cavitary
component of the lesion has moderately decreased in size, the soft tissue component of the
lesion is grossly unchanged.
A small ill-defined consolidative density is noted at the anterior aspect of the left
lower lobe measuring 2.1 x 1.0 cm (image 34, series 3). This finding is new from 12/4/2023
and likely infectious in etiology.
There is diffuse bronchial wall thickening in the left lower lobe, compatible with diffuse
bronchitis/bronchiolitis. No pneumothorax is noted in either hemithorax. There is moderate
emphysema in the right upper lobe. Chronic post radiation changes are noted at the
inferior aspect of the right middle lobe.
A trace left pleural effusion is noted. There is no right pleural effusion.
Mediastinum: The right-sided Port-A-Cath terminates at the cavoatrial junction.  The heart
is normal in size with a small pericardial effusion.
The ill-defined left perihilar soft tissue density is unchanged, in keeping with post
treatment squamous cells carcinoma. There is no mediastinal or right hilar
lymphadenopathy.  The great mediastinal vessels are unremarkable.
The thyroid gland is grossly unremarkable.  
Bones: Moderate degenerative changes are noted in the visualized spine, but without
suspicious osteolytic or osteosclerotic lesion.
The study is not designed to evaluate for intra-abdominal abnormality. The adrenal glands
are unremarkable.
