Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: The central airways are patent. There is mild diffuse bronchial wall thickening. Subsegmental and dependent atelectasis in the lung bases. There is mild upper lobe predominant centrilobular emphysema. No focal consolidation.
Tiny calcified granuloma in the RIGHT base. There are no discrete pulmonary nodules or masses.
PLEURA: The pleural spaces are clear.
MEDIASTINUM: The thyroid gland is normal. Cardiac chambers are normal in size. There is no pericardial effusion. There is mild coronary atherosclerotic calcification. Mild aortic valve calcification.
LYMPH NODES: There is no size significant supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
UPPER ABDOMEN: The visualized liver, spleen, pancreas, and kidneys are normal. There is a 1.9 cm indeterminate LEFT adrenal nodule. There is a smaller 8 mm RIGHT adrenal nodule on 4:573.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass.
BONES: There are degenerative changes. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
