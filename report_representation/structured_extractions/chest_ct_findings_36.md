Devices/Tubes/Lines: None.
Lungs: Central airways are patent. Biapical pleural-parenchymal scarring and mild scattered subpleural reticulation.
There is mucus plugging with centrilobular and tree-in-bud nodularity within the superior segment of the left lower lobe, which is worsened from prior study (3; 240). Additional mucous plugging with mild patchy consolidation within the medial segment of the right middle lobe is also worsened from prior (3; 355). 
Nodular opacification measuring up to 7 mm within the left lower lobe (3; 289) appears similar to immediate prior, although has decreased from earlier priors.
Clustered micronodules at the right lung apex, along with branching nodularity and calcification in the right lower lobe (3; 284) are unchanged. Scattered calcified granulomas.
Additional scattered faint nodules, for instance measuring 2-3 mm within the right lower lobe (3; 188 and 322) and left lung apex (3; 353) are unchanged.
Pleura: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: Unchanged left atrial enlargement. Calcification of the left ventricular papillary muscle. Mild aortic annular calcifications, and moderate mitral annular calcifications.
Mild coronary artery calcifications, most pronoucned within the LAD. No pericardial effusion.
Lymph Nodes: No size significant supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
Unchanged  paratracheal lymph node measuring up to 9 mm in short axis dimension.
Upper Abdomen: No acute abnormality within the partially imaged upper abdomen.
Chest Wall: No chest wall mass.
Bones: No acute or aggressive osseous abnormality. Multilevel moderate to severe degenerative changes within the thoracolumbar spine.
