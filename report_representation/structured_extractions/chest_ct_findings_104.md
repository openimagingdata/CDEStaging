Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: There is a new small ground-glass opacity in the left upper lobe, likely inflammatory. Similar degree of mild interlobular septal thickening and bronchial wall thickening, likely mild pulmonary edema. Mild paraseptal and centrilobular emphysema. The central airways are patent.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: Heart size is normal. No pericardial effusion. Severe amount of coronary calcifications. Mild atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta. Mildly patulous esophagus.
LYMPH NODES: Unchanged subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes, likely reactive, such as a 7 mm prevascular lymph node (5:33).
UPPER ABDOMEN: Please see concurrent abdominal CT for abdominal findings.
CHEST WALL: Slightly increased fluid and soft tissue surrounding the distal aspect of the LVAD driveline as it traverses through the upper right anterior abdominal wall (5:92).
BONES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. Healing left-sided rib fractures. Status post median sternotomy. Increased height loss of the mild compression fracture of T12.
