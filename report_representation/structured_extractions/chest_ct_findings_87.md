Devices/tubes/LINES: None.
Lungs/AIRWAYS: Status postsurgical changes in the left upper lobe. The unresected airways are patent. Unchanged calcified granulomas and a few 2-4 mm scattered pulmonary nodules for example in the right upper lobe on image 90. There is a new left lower lobe nodule on image 306.
PLEURA: No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
MEDIASTINUM: No thyroid nodules. Heart and pericardium appear normal. Moderate coronary artery calcifications. Atherosclerotic calcifications of the aorta and arch vessels.
LYMPH NODES: No supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
UPPER ABDOMEN: No abnormality in the partially imaged upper abdomen. Absence of intravenous contrast administration sensitivity for detecting solid structures and vessels.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall masses.
BONES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
