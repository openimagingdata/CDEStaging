# Report Text

Lungs: There is mild bilateral dependent atelectasis, but the lungs are symmetrically
expanded.  There is no pneumothorax, pleural effusion, or suspicious focal air-space
consolidation.  There is no pulmonary mass or suspicious nodule.  The central airways are
patent.
Mediastinum: The heart is normal in size without pericardial effusion.  There are moderate
coronary artery calcifications.
Again noted are two prominent upper mediastinal nodes. The larger one measures 21 x 17 mm,
unchanged from 11/8/2023. No hilar lymphadenopathy is noted.
The unopacified great mediastinal vessels are unremarkable.  
The thyroid gland is grossly unremarkable.  
Bones: Moderate degenerative changes are noted in the visualized spine, but without
suspicious osteolytic or osteosclerotic lesion.
The study is not designed to evaluate for intra-abdominal abnormality. The adrenal glands
are unremarkable.
