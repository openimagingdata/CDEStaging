LUNGS: New and increasing bilateral peribronchial and subpleural groundglass and patchy opacities throughout the lungs. No significant change in the size of the left lower lobe irregular mass measuring 2.3 x 1.3 cm (4:354). Similar bilateral interlobular septal thickening predominantly in the left lower lobe that may represent lymphangitis carcinomatosis. Unchanged 4 mm left upper lobe nodule (4:97). Biapical pleuroparenchymal scarring. Similar diffuse bronchial wall thickening. Patent central airways.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: Normal heart size. Trace pericardial effusion. No coronary calcification. Mild circumferential wall thickening of the distal esophagus, may represent esophagitis.
LYMPH NODES: No new enlarged supraclavicular, right axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Please see concurrent abdominal CT for abdominal findings.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass. The previously seen enhancing left breast nodules are not visualized, be due to technical differences.
BONES: Multifocal osteosclerotic metastases with increased size and density of some lesions for example in T9, T10, T12 and L1 vertebral bodies and sternal manubrium (4:107). Preserved vertebral body heights.
