# Report text

```text
Devices/Tubes/LINES: There is retraction of the right-sided pigtail catheter such that the proximal side port is extrapleural within the right subpectoral space (5:106).
LUNGS: There is intervally decreased groundglass opacity at the right lower lobe. Minimal bibasilar atelectasis persists. There are similar scattered 2 to 3 mm right-sided pulmonary nodules.
PLEURA: There are small bilateral pleural effusions. There is a persistent small right pneumothorax
MEDIASTINUM: The esophagus is again noted to be patulous. Minimal atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta. No thyroid nodules. The heart is similar in size. There is trace pericardial fluid. Moderate amount of coronary calcifications.
LYMPH NODES: No acute change since prior CT abdomen pelvis 3/19/2024.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings.
CHEST WALL: There is subcutaneous emphysema at the right anterior chest wall surrounding the pigtail catheter. There is body wall edema.
BONES: Multilevel degenerative changes of the spine. No destructive osseous lesions
