Devices/Tubes/LINES: Left subclavian stent.
LUNGS: Postsurgical changes on the left status post left upper lobe apical segmentectomy with similar soft tissue along the surgical site. Unchanged 4 mm left lower lobe subpleural nodule (4:192) and 3 mm right upper lobe nodule (4:75). Few new sub-5 mm nodules for example right upper lobe posteriorly (4:150) and subpleural right lower lobe (4: 2:30). No consolidation. The central airways are clear.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: No thyroid nodules. No pericardial effusion. Severe amount of coronary calcifications.
LYMPH NODES: No new enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Probable right renal cyst.. Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass.
BONES: Median sternotomy. Degenerative changes of the spine. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
