Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: The central airways are patent. Resolution of previously demonstrated diffuse airspace opacities. Interval development of interlobular septal thickening, greater in the lower lungs. Interval development of linear opacities in the dependent lower lungs. No air trapping. No reticular opacities on prone imaging.
PLEURA: Interval increase in small to moderate bilateral pleural effusions, greater on the right.
MEDIASTINUM: Small hiatal hernia. Trace pericardial fluid. Mild amount of coronary calcifications.
LYMPH NODES: Normal. No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Normal. No abnormality detected in the visualized upper abdomen. Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings.
CHEST WALL: Normal. No chest wall mass.
BONES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
