LUNGS: Decreased lingular opacity (5:240) and subpleural left lower lobe opacity (5:234). New 4 mm left upper lobe nodules (5:93,197). A few calcified granulomas. No new suspicious nodule or consolidation. The central airways are clear.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: No thyroid nodules. No pericardial effusion. Aortic and mitral valve replacement. Unchanged mild dilatation of the ascending aorta measuring 4.2 cm.
LYMPH NODES: No new enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings. MRI abdomen reported separately.
CHEST WALL: Mild asymmetric gynecomastia as previous, right greater than left.
BONES: No new suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. Median sternotomy. Degenerative changes of the spine.
