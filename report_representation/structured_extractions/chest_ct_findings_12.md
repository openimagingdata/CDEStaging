Devices/Tubes/Lines: None.
Lungs: Scattered sub-5 mm pulmonary nodules, including a 3 mm nodule in the right upper lobe (8:63), a 3 mm nodule in the right upper lobe (8:74), and a 2 mm nodule in the left upper lobe (8:85). No suspicious pulmonary nodules or consolidation. Central airways are patent.
Pleura: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
Mediastinum: No thyroid nodules. Heart size is normal. No pericardial effusion. No coronary calcification.
Lymph Nodes: No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
Upper Abdomen: No abnormality detected in the visualized upper abdomen. Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings.
Chest Wall: Scattered calcifications in the right breast. Unchanged 0.9 cm left breast mass (3:40).
Bones: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
