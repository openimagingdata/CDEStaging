Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: Decreased groundglass and consolidative opacities in the left lower lobe with near complete resolution of the previously described associated left lower lobe peribronchial wall thickening and endobronchial mucous plugging. Newly apparent 5 mm nodular opacity in the left lower lobe (7:340). Decreased peribronchial nodularity in the right middle lobe (7:254). Dependent and linear atelectasis in the bilateral lower lobes. Similar biapical pleural-parenchymal scarring, right greater than left. Patent central airways.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: Multichamber cardiomegaly. Large area of myocardial wall thickening involving the apical interventricular septum and apex of the left ventricle with ballooning is unchanged, corresponding to a left ventricular aneurysm Prosthetic aortic valve with the foot calcification. Severe amount of coronary calcifications. Calcific atherosclerosis of the thoracic aorta. Similar aneurysmal dilatation of the ascending thoracic aorta, which measures up to 4.7 x 4.5 cm in multiplanar reformats. Atrophic thyroid gland.
LYMPH NODES: No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Please see concurrent abdominal CT for abdominal findings.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass.
BONES: Degenerative changes of the thoracic spine. Similar sclerotic lesion in the T5 vertebral body.
