# Report Text

Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: Unchanged 3 mm right upper (6:24) and right middle (6:53) nodules. No new suspicious nodules or consolidation. Similar bilateral lower lobe subsegmental atelectasis. Patent central airways.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: Normal heart size. No pericardial effusion. Nonenlarged aorta and main pulmonary artery. Atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta and branch vessels. No coronary calcification. Small hiatal hernia.
LYMPH NODES: Normal. No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Please see concurrent abdominal CT for abdominal findings.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass.
BONES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. Partially imaged thoracolumbar spine fusion and multilevel lower thoracic vertebral augmentations, and mild anterior compression at T9, overall similar appearance. Degenerative changes of spine.
