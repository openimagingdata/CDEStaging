Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: There is central filling defect within the left upper segmental and subsegmental pulmonary arterial branches (7:254). Diffuse mild bronchial wall thickening. Right middle lingula and bilateral lower lobe linear atelectasis. 3 mm right upper lobe nodule (7:233). Right upper lobe calcified granuloma.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: No thyroid nodules. Mild multichamber cardiac enlargement. No pericardial effusion. Atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta. No CT evidence of right heart strain.
LYMPH NODES: No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Subcentimeter hepatic hypodense foci are too small to characterize. Imaged portions of the spleen, gallbladder, pancreas, adrenal glands and kidneys demonstrate no focal lesion. Diverticulosis.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass.
BONES: Diffuse osteopenia. Right shoulder reverse arthroplasty. Degenerative changes. Chronic bilateral healed rib fracture deformities. T12 severe compression fracture deformity with bony retropulsion is unchanged. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
