Devices/tubes/LINES: There is a left ventricular cardiac assist device. There has been interval removal of a right IJ CVC.
Lungs/AIRWAYS: There is stable focal thickening of the RIGHT lateral wall of the trachea subcoracoid location, with a maximal thickness of 5 mm and is best seen on image 19 in series 2. Slightly decreased thickening of interlobular septae. Decreased subsegmental atelectasis within the lingula, right middle lobe, and lower lobes. Left lower lobe granuloma (2:175). 0.9 cm nodule at the left lung base (301:370).
PLEURA: There is resolved pleural effusions.
MEDIASTINUM: No thyroid nodules.  Left ventricular cardiac assist device with limited evaluation due to beam hardening artifact. Small pericardial effusion. The cardiac chambers are stably dilated. There is stable dilation of the main pulmonary artery measuring up to 3.7 cm. Severe coronary artery calcifications.
LYMPH NODES: No supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
UPPER ABDOMEN: There are no focal lesions visualized liver, spleen, adrenals. There are vascular calcifications in the upper abdomen. Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings.
CHEST WALL: Surgical clips within the right axilla. There is a decreased fluid and gas collection with associated skin defect at the right anterior chest wall corresponding to removed IMPELLA catheter, measuring up to 3.9 cm (2:14). Trace residual fat stranding overlying the midline sternal incision, consistent with postsurgical change. There is subcutaneous nodule in the upper RIGHT anterior chest wall, most likely related to prior port or catheter placement.
BONES: Skeletal degenerative changes without suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. Median sternotomy with intact sternotomy wires.
