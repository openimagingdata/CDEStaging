Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: There are multiple small (2-3 mm) calcified bilateral pulmonary granulomata as seen on series 5 images 82, 108, 111, 115, 168, and 207. Bibasilar dependent atelectasis.
No focal lung consolidation or suspicious nodules.
PLEURA: Normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: Normal. No thyroid nodules. Moderate calcification of the coronary arteries.
LYMPH NODES: Normal. No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: There is a low-attenuation lesion in the posterior body of the pancreas measuring 9 x 10 mm. This is seen on axial series 5 image 378. This is not significantly changed in size since 2018 when it measured 8 x 9 mm. This may represent a branch IPMN.
Stable small gastric wall lipoma.
CHEST WALL: Normal. No chest wall mass.
BONES: The patient has a severe upper thoracic kyphosis at the T1-3 level. There are degenerative changes of the spine with marginal and bridging osteophytes.
