# Report text

AIRWAYS: The central airways are patent.
LUNGS AND PLEURA: Biapical scarring is noted. There are bilateral subpleural reticular
opacities consistent with underlying interstitial lung disease. There is no evidence for
fibrosis. There are a few nodular tree-in-bud opacities noted in the right middle lobe and
in the bilateral lower lobes as well as areas of nodular groundglass opacity which are
likely infectious or inflammatory in nature. There is a 4 mm right lower lobe pulmonary
nodule (7:210). A few endobronchial nodular opacities in the lower lobes bilaterally
likely represent aspirated secretions. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
UPPER ABDOMEN: For evaluation of the upper abdomen, please see the separately dictated
report for the abdominal CT performed on the same day.
BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: There is osteonecrosis of the right humeral head. There are
multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine. The visualized soft tissues appear
unremarkable.
