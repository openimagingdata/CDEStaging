Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: The central airways are patent.
There is mild bronchiectasis the RIGHT middle lobe and lingula and more significant bronchiectasis and LEFT lower lobe with some clustered nodules and secretions within the tracheobronchial tree on the LEFT (for instance 2:145). The dominant nodular opacity measures 1.3 cm (2:139) stable no evidence of new or growing pulmonary nodules.
PLEURA: No evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax
MEDIASTINUM: Posterior inferior mediastinal low attenuation cystic lesion remains unchanged likely representing a  cyst or lymphangioma.
LYMPH NODES: No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: No interval change detected in the visualized upper abdomen. Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass.
BONES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. Degenerative change
