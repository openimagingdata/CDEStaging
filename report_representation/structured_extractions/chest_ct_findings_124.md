Devices/Tubes/LINES: Percutaneous catheter drainage in the right axilla.
LUNGS: New subpleural consolidative opacity with surrounding groundglass in the anterior right upper lobe and in the right middle lobe, likely postradiation changes. Mild groundglass opacities in the left lower lobe (9:257). Triangular shaped nodule along the left major fissure measuring 3 mm 9:185), likely intrapulmonary lymph nodes. Patent central airways.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion.
MEDIASTINUM: No pericardial effusion. Mild amount of coronary calcifications. Small hiatal hernia.
LYMPH NODES: Status post right axillary lymph node dissection. No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Please see concurrent abdominal CT for abdominal findings.
CHEST WALL: Near complete resolution of previously extensive fluid collection in the right axillary region and along the right lateral chest wall with drainage in place and minimal residual fluid collection measuring 2.1 x 1.4 cm (6:27), previously 15.5 x 5.2 cm.
BONES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. Diffuse osteopenia. Multilevel degenerative changes of the axial skeleton.
