Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: The central airways are patent. There is been interval clearing of the previously demonstrated right upper lobe ground-glass opacities seen on CT neck of 10/25/2022. There are a cluster of ground-glass opacities measuring up to 7 mm in the superior segment of the right lower lobe adjacent to the major fissure (4:262), not included in the field-of-view on the prior exam. There is a 3 mm solid pulmonary nodule in the left upper lobe (4:150), unchanged since 10/25/2022.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. 
MEDIASTINUM: The heart and great vessels are within normal limits in size. No pericardial effusion. There is a partially calcified ligamentum arteriosum (4:236). Soft tissue with interspersed fat in the anterior mediastinum consistent with residual thymus.
LYMPH NODES: Please refer to separately dictated CT neck for supraclavicular details. No enlarged axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: No abnormality detected in the visualized upper abdomen.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass.
BONES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
