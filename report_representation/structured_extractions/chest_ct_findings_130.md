PORTS AND DEVICES: None.
LUNGS: A 5 mm nodule in the right lower lobe (3:71), unchanged. A few subcentimeter subpleural nodular opacities in the right middle and lower lobe (3:58) are unchanged. Interval improvement in the previously demonstrated bilateral upper lobe centrilobular groundglass attenuation and lingular and left lower lobe consolidative opacities. Minimal residual 2 mm tree-in-bud nodules in both upper lobes persist.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion.
LYMPH NODES: No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes.
MEDIASTINUM: Trace pericardial fluid. The heart is normal in size. No detectable coronary artery calcifications. Enlarged central pulmonary arteries catheter is in possibility of pulmonary hypertension. Normal diameter thoracic aorta. 
Chest Wall / BREASTS: No chest wall mass.
UPPER ABDOMEN: See separate MRI abdomen report 
MUSCULOSKELETAL: No lytic or blastic lesions.
