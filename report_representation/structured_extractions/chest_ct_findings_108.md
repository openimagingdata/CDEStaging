LUNGS: The central airways are patent. The lungs are clear
PLEURA: There is a well-circumscribed lipoma of the RIGHT chest wall and pleura measuring 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm (3:33) consistent with a lipoma. A benign etiology.No evidence of destructive process or bony abnormality or chest wall abnormality otherwise.
MEDIASTINUM: The heart and pericardium are within normal limits. There is coronary artery calcification. No evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy
LYMPH NODES: No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: No abnormality detected in the visualized upper abdomen. An exophytic renal cyst on the RIGHT measures water attenuation.
