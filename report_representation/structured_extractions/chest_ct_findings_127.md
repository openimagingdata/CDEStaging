Devices/Tubes/LINES: Tip of RIGHT peripherally inserted central catheter is near the superior cavoatrial junction.
LUNGS: The airways are clear. There is RIGHT lower lobe subpleural dependent atelectasis and/or scarring. In the LEFT lower lobe is a solid noncalcified 3 mm nodule, unchanged since at least 2019 and likely benign. No new or enlarging pulmonary nodules or consolidation.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: No thyroid nodules. No coronary artery calcification. No cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion.
LYMPH NODES: Anterior pericardiac enhancing lymph node measures up to 9 mm, unchanged compared to most recent prior but increased in size compared to 2019. No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Please see concurrent abdominal CT  for abdominal findings.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass.
BONES: There are degenerative changes. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
