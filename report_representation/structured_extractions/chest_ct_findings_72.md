Devices/Tubes/LINES: There is a leadless pacemaker in the RIGHT ventricle. The other pacemaker is in the posterior RIGHT hepatic lobe, most likely in right hepatic vein.
LUNGS: There is diffuse mild bronchial wall thickening. There are subtle centrilobular nodules predominantly in the lower lungs. There is evidence of pulmonary edema or consolidation. There are dependent opacities in the bilateral lower lobes. There is mild thickening of interlobular septae.
PLEURA: There is trace RIGHT pleural effusion..
MEDIASTINUM: Status post CABG. There is stable multichamber cardiomegaly. There are stable atherosclerotic calcifications of the native coronary arteries. There are atherosclerotic calcifications of the thoracic aorta and arch vessels. There is dilated fluid-filled esophagus. There are no nodules visualized thyroid gland.
LYMPH NODES: Normal. No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Please refer to separately dictated abdominal CT report.
CHEST WALL: There is bilateral mild symmetric gynecomastia..
BONES: Sternotomy wires are intact. There are degenerative changes without suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. There are old fractures of the LEFT 10th rib and anterior RIGHT eighth rib.
