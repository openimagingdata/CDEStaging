Devices/Tubes/LINES: Right chest wall port with catheter tip in the distal SVC.
LUNGS: The central airways are patent with mild diffuse bronchial wall thickening.
Previously described new 1 cm left upper lobe groundglass nodule has resolved.
Other pulmonary nodules are stable, EXAMPLES:
3 to 6 mm right middle and right lower lobe nodules are stable (series 5, images 188, 202, 236, and 362).
3 to 4 mm left upper lobe nodules (series 5, images 226 and 232), stable.
3 to 4 mm left lower lobe nodules (series 5, images 249, 254 and 274), stable.
No new or enlarging pulmonary nodules.
PLEURA: Small left pleural effusion, new from prior.
MEDIASTINUM: No suspicious thyroid nodules. Moderate amount of coronary calcifications. No pericardial effusion.
LYMPH NODES: Enlarged paratracheal, subcarinal and bilateral hilar lymph nodes measure up to 15 mm, similar to prior.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen. Nodular adrenal thickening is again noted, left greater than right.
CHEST WALL: Stable postoperative changes.
BONES: No destructive bone lesions.
