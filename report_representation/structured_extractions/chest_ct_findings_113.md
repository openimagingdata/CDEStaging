Devices/Tubes/LINES: Enteric tube terminating within the stomach. Surgical drain in place with the tip at the upper esophagus at the site of perforation.
LUNGS: Unchanged 4 mm nodule in the super segment of the right lower lobe (series 7 image 174). Scattered curvilinear opacities mostly in both lower lobes, in keeping with atelectasis. The airways are clear.
PLEURA: Normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: Interval resolution of previously seen fluid collection and extraluminal gas posterior to the upper esophagus (series 3 image 9). No pneumomediastinum. 
No thyroid nodules. Heart and pericardium are normal.
LYMPH NODES: Unchanged mildly prominent subcentimeter mediastinal lymph nodes, likely reactive. No new or growing lymphadenopathy within the chest.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Unremarkable postsurgical changes from the sleeve gastrectomy. Left hepatic lobe cyst. Status post splenectomy with prominent splenules. 
CHEST WALL: Normal. No chest wall mass.
BONES: Degenerative changes of the visualized spine. Unchanged hemangioma in T5, T7 and T9 vertebral bodies. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
