Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: The consolidative and masslike opacity within the right upper lobe is seen including a dominant mass in the right upper lobe measuring 4.2 x 2.7 cm (4:103), previously 4.3 x 2.6 cm, remeasured today. Interlobular septal thickening involves not only the right upper lobe but the right middle and lower lobes. Thickening along the bronchovascular bundles in the right upper lobe is noted but the airways in that lobe are patent as are the others. Scattered small bilateral pulmonary nodules are present and include a 2 mm left upper lobe nodule (4:69). 3 mm left upper lobe groundglass nodule (4:76) is present. 14 x 8 mm groundglass nodule or opacity in the superior segment of the left lower lobe is seen (4:140) and was previously measured at 13 x 13 mm. 5 mm right lower lobe nodule is stable (4:276). 
PLEURA: No change in small right-sided pleural effusion.
MEDIASTINUM: Thyroid gland is not visible. Heart is of normal size and there is no pericardial effusion. Moderate amount of coronary calcifications.
LYMPH NODES: Soft tissue opacification is seen within the mediastinal nodal stations but there are no measurable nodes that are enlarged.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Please see concurrent abdominal CT for abdominal findings.
CHEST WALL: Normal. No chest wall mass.
BONES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. Hill-Sachs fracture of the right shoulder joint with dislocation is unchanged.
