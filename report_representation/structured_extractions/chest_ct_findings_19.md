Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: There are scattered discrete pulmonary nodules measuring up to 4 mm in addition to mild scattered groundglass opacities in the left upper lobe, right middle lobe, and right lower lobe, the latter of which measures up to 14 mm TRV with a central solid appearing nodule on image 46 of series 3. There is also a small nodule along the left major fissure within the left lower lobe measuring 3 mm on image 32 of series 3, possible intrapulmonary lymph node.
PLEURA: Normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: There is mild calcification of the aortic arch. The aorta and pulmonary arteries are normal in caliber. There is dense mitral annular calcification. There is no cardiomegaly or pericardial thickening. Mild-to-moderate coronary artery calcifications are appreciated.
LYMPH NODES: Normal. No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: There is moderate calcification of the visualized abdominal aorta without aneurysmal dilatation. There is mild nodularity to the adrenal glands without discrete nodule.
CHEST WALL: Multiple coarse calcifications are appreciated in both breasts.
BONES: Mild degenerative endplate changes are seen in the mid thoracic spine.
