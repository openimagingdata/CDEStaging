Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: Unchanged radiation fibrosis in anterior left lung. Unchanged subpleural nodule in the right upper lobe measuring 5 mm (7:75). Unchanged subpleural nodule measuring 9 mm (7:239) with adjacent atelectatic band in the lingula, likely atelectasis/scar. Focal linear atelectasis in right lower lobe. Similar nodular opacity in the right lower lobe (7:244) may represent atelectasis/scarring.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Minimal pleural thickening is unchanged.
MEDIASTINUM: The heart size is normal. No pericardial effusion. 
LYMPH NODES: No enlarged supraclavicular, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Cholelithiasis, unchanged. Splenic atrophy.
CHEST WALL: Heterogeneously enhancing left axillary/chest wall mass has not significantly changed since prior and measures 2.9 x 2.6 cm (2:44), previously 3.9 x 2.7 cm is unchanged soft tissue thickening and stranding involving the left pectoral and shoulder musculature. Subcutaneous nodule measuring 1.7 cm in posterior to left scapula (2:15) is also unchanged.
BONES: Multiple chronic left ribs and scapular fractures are unchanged.
