Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: There are new (recurrent) extensive perilymphatic micronodules involving all lobes of both lungs. Several more confluent nodular opacities are present representing the galaxy sign (for example series 7 image 97). The central airways are patent.
PLEURA: Trace pleural effusions
MEDIASTINUM: Heart size is normal. No pericardial effusion. There are moderate coronary artery calcifications.
LYMPH NODES: Right paratracheal lymph node on series 2 image 28 measures 1.6 cm, previously 0.8 cm . Para-aortic lymph node on image 34 measures 8 mm, previously 5 mm. Subcarinal lymph node is newly enlarged, measuring 11 mm on image 49. There are also small bilateral hilar lymph nodes that are newly enlarged.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Multiple mildly enlarged gastrohepatic ligament lymph nodes are new, for example on series 2 image 92 measuring 1.7 cm .
CHEST WALL: Normal. No chest wall mass.
BONES: Normal. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
