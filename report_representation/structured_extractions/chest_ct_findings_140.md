Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: Postsurgical changes status post right upper lobectomy with similar soft tissue thickening along the surgical site. Unchanged 3 mm left lower lobe nodule (12:302). No consolidation. The central airways are clear.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: Redemonstrated hypodense thyroid nodules. No pericardial effusion. Coronary artery calcifications. Status post CABG. Redemonstrated subendocardial fatty metaplasia in the interventricular septum and apex likely sequela of prior myocardial infarction. Small hiatal hernia.
LYMPH NODES: No new enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Please see concurrent abdominal CT for abdominal findings.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass. Collateral filling on the left may be related to some narrowing of the subclavian vein.
BONES: Median sternotomy. No new suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. Degenerative changes of the spine.
