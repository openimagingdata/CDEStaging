Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: Mild bibasilar atelectasis. Linear scarring/atelectasis in the left lower lobe. No suspicious lung nodule. No consolidation. Prone imaging shows no ground glass opacity. Expiratory imaging shows no significant air trapping.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: PFO closure device. No pericardial effusion.
LYMPH NODES: No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings. Status post cholecystectomy.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass.
BONES: Posterior thoracolumbar spine fusion hardware. Severe S shaped scoliosis of the thoracic spine. Chronic appearing deformity of the left glenohumeral joint. Bones are osteopenic
