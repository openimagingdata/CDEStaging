LUNGS: Status post right lower lobectomy. Previously seen consolidation  in the right upper lobe along surgical sutures has resolved. There is a stable 5 mm subpleural nodule in the basilar left lower lobe on image 359. Additional 2 to 3 mm lung nodules are essentially stable for example in the right middle lobe on image 349 and along the left major fissure on image 348.
PLEURA: Persistent trace loculated right basilar pleural effusion.
MEDIASTINUM: Cardiac chambers are normal in size. No pericardial effusion.
LYMPH NODES: Normal. No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: No abnormality detected in the visualized spleen or adrenal glands. Known hepatic hemangiomas are better assessed on prior abdominal MRI.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass.
BONES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
