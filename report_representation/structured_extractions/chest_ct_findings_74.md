Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: Perilesional interlobular septal thickening in the left lung (5:110, 194), likely representing lymphangitis carcinomatosis. Mild diffuse bronchial wall thickening. Moderate centrilobular emphysema predominantly in the upper lung more on the right. Right upper lobe calcified granuloma. Limited assessment of the lower lung due to breathing related motion artifacts. The airways are clear.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: No thyroid nodules. Heart and pericardium are normal. Severe amount of coronary calcifications. Mild calcifications in the thoracic aorta.
LYMPH NODES: 1.8 x 1.0 cm subaortic node (3:40) and 1.3 x 0.9 cm node in the left anterior mediastinum (3:41). No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Scattered colonic diverticulosis. 1.2 cm right renal low-attenuation partially partially exophytic lesion (3:93), likely cyst. Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings.
CHEST WALL: Status post bilateral mastectomies. Postsurgical change in the left anterior chest wall. Also see lung section. 
BONES: Also see lung section. Mild degenerative changes and osteopenia in the spine. Moderate compression deformity of the T12 superior endplate and T9 inferior endplate.
