Devices/tubes/LINES: None.
Lungs/AIRWAYS: The central airways are patent. Stable left apical post radiation changes. No significant change in upper/midlung predominant linear opacities.
Unchanged 3 mm right upper lobe nodule series 4 image 60. There are multiple additional tiny nodules measuring up to 3 mm in the left lower lobe series 4 image 252.
PLEURA: No pleural effusions or pneumothoraces.
MEDIASTINUM: No thyroid nodules. Heart and pericardium appear normal.
LYMPH NODES: 1.3 cm right axillary node.
UPPER ABDOMEN: There is a partially calcified left renal artery aneurysm measuring 1.4 cm. Calcific atherosclerotic involvement of the abdominal aorta.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall masses.
BONES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
