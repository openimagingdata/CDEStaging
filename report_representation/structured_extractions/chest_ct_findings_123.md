PORTS AND DEVICES: A right subclavian Infuse-a-Port catheter terminates in the right atrium.
LUNGS: There is linear atelectasis and mild bronchiectasis in left lower lobe. There is no suspicious pulmonary nodule, mass,or focal consolidation.
PLEURA: There is interval decrease in size of the left pleural effusions now small in size. There is no pneumothorax.
LYMPH NODES: There is no significant supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymphadenopathy.
MEDIASTINUM: The heart is normal in size without significant pericardial effusion. There is a patent ductus arteriosus. At the distal aspect of the PDA within the main pulmonary artery, there
is a lobular filling defect (series 2 image 38; series 6 image 63) suspicious for thrombus.
Chest Wall / BREASTS: Normal.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Nodular areas of peritoneal carcinomatosis are
noted and completely described on the concurrent CT abdomen/pelvis examination.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: There is no acute fracture. There is no lytic or sclerotic osseous metastatic disease.
