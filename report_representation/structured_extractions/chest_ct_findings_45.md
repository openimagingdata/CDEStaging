Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: The central airways are patent. Calcified granuloma right upper lung. No new or enlarging pulmonary nodules. No new areas of consolidation
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Resolution of previously demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions.
MEDIASTINUM: Status post cardiac transplant. No coronary calcification.
LYMPH NODES: Normal. No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Normal. No abnormality detected in the visualized upper abdomen. Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings.
CHEST WALL: Old pacemaker pocket subcutaneous tissues upper anterior left hemithorax. Resolution of air and fluid in the right supraclavicular region consistent with resolving postoperative seroma.
BONES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
