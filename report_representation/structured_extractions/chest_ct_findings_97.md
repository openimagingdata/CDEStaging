LUNGS/PLEURA: Again noted is bilateral diffuse subpleural reticulation in both upper and
lower lobes with mild traction bronchiectasis. There is no definite honeycomb fibrosis.
Findings are similar compared with prior study.
MEDIASTINUM: There is no evidence of mediastinal or hilar adenopathy. Coronary artery
calcifications are present. There is atherosclerotic change within the aorta without
evidence of aneurysmal dilatation. 'S enlargement of the central pulmonary arteries
compatible with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Within normal limits.
BONES: Multilevel degenerative changes are present. There are no acute fractures.
SOFT TISSUE/AXILLAE: Within normal limits.
