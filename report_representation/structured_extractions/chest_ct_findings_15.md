PORTS AND DEVICES: None.
LUNGS: There is mild atelectasis in the medial segment of the right middle lobe. No suspicious nodules are seen. The central airways are patent.
PLEURA: There is trace right pleural fluid.
LYMPH NODES: No lymphadenopathy.
MEDIASTINUM: Heart size is overall normal, although left ventricle is mildly
enlarged. There are moderate coronary artery calcifications as well as severe
aortic valve calcifications. Postsurgical changes are identified from prior
ascending aortic repair. There are also surgical clips in the anterior
mediastinum. The aortic root is dilated, measuring 4.5 x 3.9 cm. No evidence of
adhesions to the prior sternotomy.
Chest Wall / BREASTS: Normal.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Scattered tiny hypodense hepatic lesions likely represent cysts.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: No suspicious osseous lesions are seen.
