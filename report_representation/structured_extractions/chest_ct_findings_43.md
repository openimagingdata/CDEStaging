Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: The tree-in-bud nodules in the right upper lobe (4:86 through 4:120) are again identified and similar. Much less significant tree-in-bud nodules in the left lower lobe are stable. There are no new or concerning lung nodules. Several calcified granulomas are present. The airways are patent..
PLEURA: Normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: Thyroid gland is grossly normal. The main pulmonary artery significantly enlarged measuring 5.7 cm, previously 5.9 cm. Is no pericardial effusion. The esophagus is dilated as before without change. Severe amount of coronary calcifications. However the patient has undergone CABG.
LYMPH NODES: Normal. No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: The liver and spleen are grossly normal. The kidneys are markedly atrophic
CHEST WALL: There are no chest wall masses.
BONES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
