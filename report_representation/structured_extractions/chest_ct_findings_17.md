Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: The central airways are patent. There are multiple bilateral thin-walled cysts. Incidentally noted azygos fissure. No focal consolidation to suggest pneumonia. Minimal reticulation in the lung bases. These cysts appear grossly unchanged when compared to 2013. Few scattered punctate calcified nodules. PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: The imaged thyroid gland is unremarkable within limitations of overlying artifact. Normal size of cardiac chambers. No pericardial effusion. No coronary calcification. Scattered calcifications of the bovine configuration thoracic aorta. No evidence of aortic aneurysm.
LYMPH NODES: No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes within limitations of unenhanced technique.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings. No focal abnormality within the imaged liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands or renal upper poles. Scattered calcifications of the imaged abdominal vasculature.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass.
BONES: Mild multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracolumbar spine. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
