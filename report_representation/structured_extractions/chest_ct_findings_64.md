There is a calcified granuloma in the right lower lobe (5:272). No consolidation.
No pleural effusion or pneumothorax. There is no pericardial effusion.
No enlarged axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
Limited visualization of the upper abdomen demonstrates no acute abnormality but otherwise is limited in assessment due to limited excursion and contrast timing. There is hepatic steatosis.
Tiny sclerotic foci in the left humeral head, likely bone islands. No gross destructive osseous lesions are seen along the spine.
