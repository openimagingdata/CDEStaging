Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: The central airways are patent. There is mild diffuse bronchial there is mild centrilobular emphysema. There is a small amount of linear atelectasis in the medial right middle lobe and medial left upper lobe.
There are a few scattered pulmonary nodules measuring up to 3 mm, for example right upper lobe, 3:23, and left upper lobe, 3:30. These are all unchanged since 2/4/2022.
There are no new or enlarging nodules.
PLEURA: Normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: Normal. No thyroid nodules. Heart and pericardium are normal. Mild amount of coronary calcifications.
LYMPH NODES: Normal. No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Normal. No abnormality detected in the visualized upper abdomen. Absence of intravenous contrast limits sensitivity for detecting solid organ findings.
CHEST WALL: Bilateral breast implants. There has either been revision or collapse of the left implant.
BONES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
