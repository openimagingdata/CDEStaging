Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: There is geographic focus of mild diffuse bronchial wall thickening clustered nodules tree-in-bud opacities and groundglass opacities in the RIGHT upper lobe and peripherally at the LEFT lung base. Conversely, there is been interval clearing of the multifocal consolidation at the RIGHT lung base.
PLEURA: No evidence of pleural effusion or pneumothorax
MEDIASTINUM: The heart and pericardium remain stable. Severe coronary artery calcification. No evidence of pericardial effusion. Esophageal varices remain
LYMPH NODES: No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Not included on this examination
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass.
BONES: Degenerative changes no evidence of lytic or blastic lesions.
