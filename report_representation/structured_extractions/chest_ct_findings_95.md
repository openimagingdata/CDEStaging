Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: Similar size of few scattered sub-5 mm bilateral pulmonary nodules, for example, 2-3 mm subpleural left upper and lower lobe nodules (7:87 and 7:209), and 3 mm right lower lobe nodule (7:200). Patent central airways.
PLEURA: Similar mild biapical pleural-parenchymal scarring. No definite pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: Heart size is normal. No pericardial effusion. No coronary calcification. Postsurgical changes in the lower neck. 
LYMPH NODES: No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Same-day abdominal MRI is reported separately.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass.
BONES: No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions. Degenerative changes of the spine. Osteopenia.
