# Report Text

Devices/tubes/LINES: None.
Lungs/AIRWAYS: Patent central airways. New bilateral relaxation atelectasis adjacent to pleural effusions.
PLEURA: New small lateral pleural effusions. No pneumothoraces.
MEDIASTINUM: Ascending aortic dissection flap with the tear anterior and inferior to the brachiocephalic artery origin, the false lumen extending proximally to the aortic valve annular ring and right coronary artery. Opacification of the right coronary artery is not well demonstrated, however there is normal cardiac motion artifact.
The dissection propagates distally to immediately beyond the left subclavian artery origin.
The true lumen is compressed immediately distal to the aortic bulb and the total combined ascending aorta is aneurysmal to 64 mm
There is a small pericardial effusion. Moderate coronary artery calcifications.
LYMPH NODES: Subcarinal lymphadenopathy to 14 mm.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Reported separately.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall masses.
BONES: No suspicious bone lesions.
