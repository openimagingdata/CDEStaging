Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
Lungs and pleura: Status post right upper lobectomy. Stable appearance along the suture
margin. No new nodularity.
2 mm endobronchial nodule within the right lower lobe (7:145) appears stable. Branching
calcifications within the right lower lobe unchanged. 1 mm left perifissural pulmonary
nodule (7:152) appears new. There is scarring at the bilateral lung bases. There is no
focal consolidation. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Central airways are
intact.
Mediastinum: Thyroid unremarkable. Heart is normal in size. There is no pericardial
effusion. There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.
