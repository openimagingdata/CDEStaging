Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: Central airways are patent. There are solid 2 mm pulmonary nodules, for example in the right upper lobe (3:61 and 188), and left upper lobe (3:225). Scattered calcified granulomas. No consolidation or suspicious nodules.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: The thyroid gland cannot be accurately evaluated secondary to overlying artifact. Cardiac chambers are within normal limits in size. No pericardial effusion. Mild amount of coronary calcifications. Circumferential distal esophageal wall thickening.
LYMPH NODES: No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: No abnormality detected in the visualized upper abdomen.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass.
Bones/SOFT TISSUES: No suspicious osseous lesions. Multilevel degenerative changes in the thoracic spine.
