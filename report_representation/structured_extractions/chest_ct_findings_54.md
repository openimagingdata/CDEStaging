is scarring at the left lung apex. No new pulmonary nodules or masses. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: Thyroid unremarkable. Heart is normal in size. Coronary calcifications
present. No mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. There is fluid within the esophagus.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Adrenal glands unremarkable. Duplex right kidney with nonobstructing stones
measuring up to 1.2 cm again seen.
