Devices/Tubes/LINES: None. 
LUNGS: Right apical radiation fibrosis. New minimal lingular and bilateral lower lobe peribronchial groundglass opacities with associated septal thickening.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: Normal sized heart. Mild coronary artery calcifications. Normal sized thoracic aorta and pulmonary arteries. 
LYMPH NODES: No enlarged thoracic lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: No detectable abnormality in the upper abdomen.
CHEST WALL: Continued increase in size of the intermediate to low attenuation lesion in the right anterior chest wall, just posterior to the mesh, which demonstrates mild peripheral enhancement. The largest medial component now measures 40 x 30 mm, previously measuring 27 x 20 mm. Surgical changes of right anterior chest wall with partial rib resections.
BONES: No osseous lesions. Preservation of vertebral body heights.
