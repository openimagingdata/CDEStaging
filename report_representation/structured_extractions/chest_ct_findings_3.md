Devices/Tubes/LINES: Since the mediastinum terminating in right atrium.
LUNGS: Scattered lung nodules are essentially unchanged, including 2 mm right upper lobe groundglass nodule on series 7 image 61, and 2 mm left upper lobe nodule on image 108. No new suspicious discrete pulmonary nodules or consolidation. Atelectasis is noted adjacent to the expansile right posterior ninth rib lesion as before.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion.
MEDIASTINUM: Small hiatal hernia.
LYMPH NODES: No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Please see concurrent abdominal MRI for abdominal findings.
CHEST WALL: Unchanged low-density 2.0 x 1.6 cm subcutaneous oval-shaped nodule likely representing a sebaceous cyst, unchanged. Bilateral mild gynecomastia.
BONES: Again note is made of multifocal predominantly sclerotic osseous metastasis throughout the visualized skeletal structures, overall slightly increased, for example measuring 5.8 x 2.4 cm in the right posterior ninth rib measuring 5.8 x 2.0 cm compared to 4.4 x 2.1 cm on the prior. Other lesions have also increased in extent of sclerotic lesions in bilateral ribs for example in the posterior left ninth rib on image 234, as well as on the right lateral third rib with increased periosteal reaction. Sclerotic foci have also increased in the sternum, scapula and thoracic spine, with persistent irregular appearance at T11 with underlying compression deformity, associated with narrowing of the spinal canal along the right anterior aspect as noted previously, with mildly increased periosteal reaction on series 7 image 314. Please note that the assessment of the thoracic spine and spinal canal is limited on this chest CT.
