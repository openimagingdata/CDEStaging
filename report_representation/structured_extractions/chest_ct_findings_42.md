Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: Central airways are patent. Subsegmental atelectasis in the basal right middle and lower lobes. Groundglass opacities in the medial basal segment of right lower lobe and paravertebral location. Dependent atelectasis in the left lower lobe. Ill-defined triangular-shaped peribronchovascular nodular opacity in the left upper lobe (12:122) measuring 2 x 1.8 cm with linear nodularity as seen on image 138 of series 17.
There are multiple small calcified and non calcified nodules along the right fissure 274, 271, 268, 261. Other small discrete pulmonary nodules measuring up to the 4 mm as seen on images 308, 171, 401, 330, 279, 259, 112, 123, 125, 93.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: No thyroid nodule. Enlarged left atrium. No pericardial effusion. Enlarged pulmonary artery measuring 3.1 cm. Dilated ascending aorta measuring 4.1 cm and descending aorta measuring 3 cm. Severe amount of coronary calcifications. Atherosclerotic calcification of the thoracic aorta and its branch vessels.
LYMPH NODES: Multiple enlarged left supraclavicular, mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes measuring up to 2.2 cm in short axis on series 12 with coarse calcifications. Enlarged right superior diaphragmatic lymph nodes measuring up to 8 mm in short axis on image 408
UPPER ABDOMEN: Please see concurrent abdominal CT for abdominal findings.
CHEST WALL: Exophytic mass in the medial right breast measuring 4.2 x 1 cm (12:165).
BONES: Severe degenerative changes of the visualized spine with multilevel mild compression deformities. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesion. Old right clavicle fracture.
