PORTS AND DEVICES: None.
LUNGS: Saber-sheath trachea with mild to moderate upper lobe predominant emphysema. Mild bronchiectasis is greatest in right lower lobe.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion.

MEDIASTINUM: Main pulmonary artery measures 2.7 cm in diameter.
Minimal aortic and coronary artery calcifications..
Chest Wall / BREASTS: Dependent infiltration of subcutaneous fat may reflect volume overload.
UPPER ABDOMEN: No adrenal mass.
MUSCULOSKELETAL: No obvious destructive bone lesion.
