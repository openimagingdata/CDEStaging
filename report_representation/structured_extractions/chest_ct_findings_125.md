Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: Unchanged nodules at the fissures such as along the right major fissure (7:200). Mild bibasilar atelectasis. Patent central airways.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: Unchanged right thyroid nodule. The heart size is normal. No pericardial effusion.  Moderate amount of coronary calcifications. Unchanged lobulated fluid-attenuating focus in the right pericardial fat pad, measuring 4.2 x 3.1 cm (2:76), likely a pericardial cyst.
LYMPH NODES: No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Unchanged hepatic cyst. Postcholecystectomy changes. Partially imaged hypoattenuating focus in the spleen, unchanged, likely benign.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass.
BONES: Partially imaged sclerotic lesion in the proximal left humerus, likely a low-grade chondral lesion. Thoracic spine degenerative changes. Unchanged small sclerotic focus in the T2 vertebral body, likely a bone island.
