Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
Lungs: Moderate centrilobular emphysema is noted with upper zone predominance.
The patient is status post right middle lobectomy and left upper lobe wedge resection.
There is a 1.2 x 1.2 cm soft tissue nodule at the wedge resection resection site,
unchanged from 11/16/2023.
There are geographic consolidative densities at the medial aspect of the right lower lobe,
in keeping with post radiation changes.
At the posteromedial aspect of the right lower lobe, there is a chronic consolidative
density, measuring 12 x 7 mm, unchanged (image 49, series 3).  A 3 mm solid nodule is
again noted at the anterior aspect of the right upper lobe, unchanged (image 36, series
3). An ill-defined consolidated density is unchanged in the posterior aspect of the right
upper lobe (image 26, series 3). While these are grossly unchanged from 11/16/2023,
concern is raised for multifocal lung adenocarcinoma and atypical adenomatous hyperplasia.
Mediastinum: The heart is normal in size without pericardial effusion.  There are mild
coronary artery calcifications
There is no mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy.  The unopacified great mediastinal
vessels are unremarkable.  
The thyroid gland is grossly unremarkable.  
Bones: Mild-to-moderate degenerative changes are noted in the visualized spine, but
without suspicious osteolytic or osteosclerotic lesion. A chronic mild anterior wedge
compression fracture is again noted at T12. There is no retropulsion into the spinal
canal.
Assessment of the visualized upper abdomen is deferred to the separately dictated report
of the concurrent CT abdomen and pelvis study.
