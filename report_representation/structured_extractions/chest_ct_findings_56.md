Devices/Tubes/LINES: Right internal jugular port catheter terminates at the superior cavoatrial junction
LUNGS: Multiple pulmonary cysts, with perivascular distribution, are unchanged. Right upper lobe nodule on image 116 measuring 2 mm is unchanged. Triangular right middle lobe nodule on image 209 measuring 5 mm is unchanged. 2 mm left upper lobe nodule on image 107 is unchanged, as is a 2 mm left upper lobe nodule on image 118. The central airways are patent.
PLEURA: Normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: Heart size is normal. No pericardial effusion. Upper esophageal mass has substantially decreased in size, previously 5.2 x 4.4 cm, presently at most 3.4 x 3.1 cm (series 6 image 31).
LYMPH NODES: Subcarinal lymph node has decreased from 1.5 cm to 0.8 cm on image 50. Previously seen left hilar lymphadenopathy has resolved.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Please see concurrent abdominal CT for abdominal findings.
CHEST WALL: Normal. No chest wall mass.
BONES: Unchanged lytic lesion at C6. No new osseous lesions.
