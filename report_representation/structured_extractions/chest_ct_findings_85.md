Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: There is mild radiation fibrosis in the anterior right lung, with adjacent linear scarring. Mild subpleural reticulation is noted in the right lung base, representing an interstitial lung abnormality. The central airways are patent.
PLEURA: Normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: Heart is mildly enlarged. No pericardial effusion. There are severe coronary artery calcifications.
LYMPH NODES: Normal. No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: There is pneumobilia.
CHEST WALL: Normal. No chest wall mass.
BONES: Multilevel degenerative disc disease in the thoracic spine. No suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.
