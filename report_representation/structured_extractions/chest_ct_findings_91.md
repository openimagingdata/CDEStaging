Devices/Tubes/LINES: Right-sided port catheter terminating at superior cavoatrial junction
LUNGS: Central airways are patent. Unchanged 5 mm nodule in left lower lobe (4:333) and 2 mm subpleural nodule in the lingula (4:243). Scattered subsegmental atelectasis in middle lobe, lingula and both lower lobes. No new suspicious lung nodule or consolidation.
PLEURA: No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: No pericardial effusion. Mild amount of coronary calcifications.
LYMPH NODES: No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Please see concurrent abdominal CT for abdominal findings.
CHEST WALL: No chest wall mass.
BONES: Healing sternal fracture. Similar hemangiomas in thoracic vertebral bodies. Vertebral body heights are preserved. Old right-sided rib fractures.
