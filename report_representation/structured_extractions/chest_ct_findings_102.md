Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: Central airways are patent. No consolidation. Calcified right lower lobe granuloma. Few tiny foci of distal airway mucous plugging. No suspicious pulmonary nodule.
PLEURA: Normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: Left atrial enlargement. Dense mitral annular calcifications.
LYMPH NODES: Normal. No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Partially imaged upper abdomen demonstrates benign hepatic cysts, otherwise grossly unremarkable.
CHEST WALL: Normal. No chest wall mass.
BONES: Mild spine degenerative changes. No suspicious focal osseous lesion.
HEART AND MEDIASTINUM: The heart is unremarkable in appearance. Atherosclerotic
calcifications are noted at the aortic arch. There is no evidence of mediastinal or hilar
lymphadenopathy. There is a 4.5 cm right thyroid nodule which extends into the upper
mediastinum, similar in appearance to the prior exam. This deviates the trachea to the
left.
