Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: Central airways are patent. No consolidation. Calcified right lower lobe granuloma. Few tiny foci of distal airway mucous plugging. No suspicious pulmonary nodule.
PLEURA: Normal. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: Left atrial enlargement. Dense mitral annular calcifications.
LYMPH NODES: Normal. No enlarged supraclavicular, axillary, mediastinal, or hilar lymph nodes.
UPPER ABDOMEN: Partially imaged upper abdomen demonstrates benign hepatic cysts, otherwise grossly unremarkable.
CHEST WALL: Normal. No chest wall mass.
BONES: Mild spine degenerative changes. No suspicious focal osseous lesion.
 HEART AND MEDIASTINUM: The heart is unremarkable in appearance. Atherosclerotic
calcifications are noted at the aortic arch. There is no evidence of mediastinal or hilar
lymphadenopathy. There is a 4.5 cm right thyroid nodule which extends into the upper
mediastinum, similar in appearance to the prior exam. This deviates the trachea to the
left.
AIRWAYS: The central airways are patent.
 
LUNGS AND PLEURA: Biapical scarring is noted. There are bilateral subpleural reticular
opacities consistent with underlying interstitial lung disease. There is no evidence for
fibrosis. There are a few nodular tree-in-bud opacities noted in the right middle lobe and
in the bilateral lower lobes as well as areas of nodular groundglass opacity which are
likely infectious or inflammatory in nature. There is a 4 mm right lower lobe pulmonary
nodule (7:210). A few endobronchial nodular opacities in the lower lobes bilaterally
likely represent aspirated secretions. There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.
 
UPPER ABDOMEN: For evaluation of the upper abdomen, please see the separately dictated
report for the abdominal CT performed on the same day.
 
BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: There is osteonecrosis of the right humeral head. There are
multilevel degenerative changes of the thoracic spine. The visualized soft tissues appear
unremarkable.
