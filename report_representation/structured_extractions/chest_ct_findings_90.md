Devices/Tubes/LINES: None.
LUNGS: As before, there are a few calcified pulmonary granulomata. Few small noncalcified pulmonary nodules measuring up to 5 mm (for example 6:306 in the right lower lobe and 6:393 in the left lower lobe) are unchanged from February 2022. No new or enlarging pulmonary nodule.
PLEURA: No effusion. No pneumothorax.
MEDIASTINUM: There are coronary artery calcifications. No pericardial effusion. Residual thymus in the anterior mediastinum appears similar to priors, including February 2022.
LYMPH NODES: No thoracic adenopathy.
UPPER ABDOMEN: A 1.3 cm rounded hypodensity in the dome of the liver (6:438 and 7:55) is unchanged from February 2022 CT in December 2022 MRI. Right renal cysts. A right upper pole nonobstructing renal stone measures 7 mm. 
CHEST WALL: No new abnormality.
BONES: No suspicious bone lesion.
